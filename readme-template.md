##Features

### Add IDs
`ids()` will make sure everything in the DOM has an ID.

### Compare styles
`compare(a, b, ...)` will return an object showing differences in the CSS of two or more elements. It will also outline the elements in the colours specified in `compare.colours`. By default it will not show `border-width`, for example, and include only `border`. Change `compare.all` to configure this.
